   "Machine Learning (ML) applications are making a considerable impact on healthcare. ML is a subtype of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that aims to improve the speed and accuracy of physicians work. Countries are currently dealing with an overburdened healthcare system with a shortage of skilled physicians, where AI provides a big hope. The healthcare data can be used gainfully to identify the optimal trial sample, collect more data points, assess ongoing data from trial participants, and eliminate data-based errors. ML-based techniques assist in detecting early indicators of an epidemic or pandemic. This algorithm examines satellite data, news and social media reports, and even video sources to determine whether the sickness will become out of control. Using ML for healthcare can open up a world of possibilities in this field. It frees up healthcare providers time to focus on patient care rather than searching or entering information."
